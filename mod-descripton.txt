[h1]Main Features[/h1]
TwitchToolkit adds to big features including the storytelling voting and coin store, both work standalone of each other.

[h1]Storyteller Voting[/h1]
TwitchToolkit adds 3 new vanilla-like storytellers into the game. The Uristbot(cassy), Spartanbot(phoebe), and Hodlbot(randy) all use similar storyteller patterns to the base game. The difference is instead of coming up with only one possible outcome they come up with more depending on how many vote options you have max. This is not based on a real world timer but uses in game time to decide when incidents should occur.

New votes will show up on screen with a timer while the current results update in real time. You can drag the vote box to your preferred position.

[h1]Coin Store[/h1]
TwitchToolkit adds the coin store which it is notorious for. Your viewers will earn coins per minute based on your settings. These coins can be spent on storytelling events and different tradeable ingame items. Events will happen immediately and items will come from cargo pods dropped near your base.

When purchasing an item/event, any message included after the command is included in the letter notification in game. See screenshots

Events have cooldowns to prevent absolute insanity (of course this can be turned off) and uses the games brain to decide if certain things can happen.

Items are generated from your custom game, so if you have mods with tradeable items, those items will be available in your purchase list.

[h1]Karma System[/h1]
As much as we'd all love to send 50 raids to our favorite twitch streamers, we need to balance things out. To do this a karma system is in use that rewards users for good events & items while punishing users for bad events. Your karma rate will decide how many coins you earn per interval up to your set karma cap. The base recommended Karma cap is 140% and any higher viewers will snowball the coins they earn.

The more you spend on items/good events the more coins you will make overall.

[h1]Custom Pricing[/h1]
Items and events included in your game can have their pricing changed. Once you have completed editing your prices you can output them to a custom spreadsheet. A wonderful guide by the Twitch.tv/Kruffles will help you setup your custom pricing for your viewers, that you can view here:

[h1]Coins Settings[/h1]
Coins section of the mod settings

Reward coins: Toggles whether or not your viewers are earning coins

Store Open: Toggles whether or not your viewers can purchase items/events

Viewers can gift other viewers coins: Toggles gifting(trading) of coins between viewers. This is off by default since it can easily be abused by alt accounts. I recommend turning this off for streams that can’t be properly moderated.

Coins per interval: Your viewers will get this many base coins every coin reward round

Max Karma: What is the maximum bonus percentage of coins viewers can earn (For example: 140% means viewers would earn extra 40% of base reward)

Minimum Purchase Price: To prevent spam of low priced items, a minimum purchase price will require viewers to spend a min amount of coins to complete a purchase.

Minutes between coin reward: How often should viewers be reward the base coins + karma bonus

Starting Balance: How many coins should new viewers start with

Starting Karma: What percentage of the base coin reward should new viewers start with

Link to custom pricing sheet: This will change the outputted link to the pricing sheet to your custom sheet

[h1]Events Settings[/h1]
Events section of mod settings

At the top of this box is a search box that can be used to quickly find events you are looking for. Next to the search box are the up/down scrolling. To the right of that is the price multipliers that will change the pricing of all events at once. Lastly, is the reset to default button which will ensure your events are working right, are up to date, and have default values.

Each of the events listed have the following options:

Price of each event can be changed with the integer buttons.

The type of karma given to the player for the event, so bad events take down karma and good events pull up karma. An example of when you might change this, if you are running a cannibal colony it would make sense for the cannibal trait to be a good thing.

The disable button sets the price to 0 which makes the event unbuyable, to turn an event back on raise the price.

The max button is the maximum amount of times the event can happen within your cooldown period. The cooldown period is set in the options section of the mod settings.


[h1]Items Settings[/h1]
Items sections of mod settings

The items section also has a search bar for quickly finding items. The reset to default will make sure all tradeable items in your current game + mods will be loaded into your purchase list. The price for items are calculated off the basemarketvalue of items. Each items price can be altered or items can be disabled entirely.

[h1]Options Settings[/h1]
Options section of mod settings

Should buildings unable to be uninstalled be included in the item list? This option was never intended for the full release, however, this bug turned into a feature. It is recommended to keep this off as it makes it so you can’t purchase ‘buildings’. An example of this would be a grave, which would wall from the sky and immediately construct itself. This can cause unwanted consequences like destroying items, destroying buildings, or never appearing in the first place.

Should viewers have unlimited coins? Self-explanatory, should the game check if viewers have enough coins?

Should events have cooldowns? This prevents events from being spammed past their max value within their cooldown period.

Should viewer names be repeated in raids/aid? This is a cool feature but can be buggy down the road if you don’t use a mod like RuntimeGC for cleaning up old pawns. To my understanding, by generating tons of pawns with the same name you could potentially cause issues.

Large voting window? If you stream at a lower resolution than 1080p or have a lot of mobile viewers, you may want to make the voting window larger.

How many minutes in a cooldown period? This is how often the max of each event can be hit. So for a big raid, if a viewer purchased this the next viewer would have to wait 15 mins before purchase. For events with a higher max of 1 it will work slightly different. If an event has a max of two and a viewer purchases one it will work like this.

Viewer 1 purchases inspiration. Viewer 2 purchases inspiration 5 minutes later. Viewer 3 tries to purchase inspiration but it is on cooldown, it takes another 10 minutes for the first viewers purchase to not be counted in the cooldown.

Separate chatroom uuid and and channel id are beta features and are not supported. Use at your own risk. Will be supported in near feature when bug free.

[h1]Command Settings[/h1]
Commands section of mod settings

Commands can be whispered? This allows viewers to whisper their commands to the username set.

Commands must be whispered? Forces viewers to whisper their command to the username set

Should purchases be confirmed in chat? Creates a confirmation message upon successful purchase of item/event. This is spammy which is why you might want it off.

The rest of the settings in this section allow you to change the commands incase they conflict with other stream commands. If you click reset commands, it will attempt to translate the commands into your language.
